A robust, reliable, and efficient reverse proxy for NAT traversal, developed in Rust

CloudPub, similar to ngrok (https://github.com/inconshreveable/ngrok), facilitates the exposure of services on devices situated behind NAT to the Internet by leveraging a server with a public IP.

## What is CloudPub

CloudPub is a globally distributed reverse proxy designed to secure, protect, and accelerate your applications and network services, regardless of their deployment location. As a comprehensive gateway to your applications, CloudPub integrates reverse proxy functionality, firewall capabilities, API gateway, and global load balancing into a single solution. Additionally, CloudPub can capture and analyze all traffic to your web services for future inspection and replay.
